# Daily Word Search

This project is a simple daily word search game built with the Godot Engine. It retrieves a puzzle for the current date from a web service and allows you to find words in the grid. Fonts and color palettes can be cycled at runtime for quick visual experimentation.

## Running
1. Install **Godot 4**.
2. Open `project.godot` in the `dailywordsearch` directory with the editor.
3. Run the project to launch the main menu.

## Keyboard Controls
- **T** – cycle the font used for the title label
- **G** – cycle the font used for the grid letters
- **W** – cycle the font used for the word bank
- **P** – cycle between the available color palettes

Each time you change a font or palette, the current selection is printed to the console.
