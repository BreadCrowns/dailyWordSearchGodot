# Daily Word Search

This project is a simple daily word search game built with the Godot Engine. It retrieves a puzzle for the current date from a web service and allows you to find words in the grid. Fonts and colors are configured in a shared theme so the appearance is consistent across the game.

## Running
1. Install **Godot 4**.
2. Open `project.godot` in the `dailywordsearch` directory with the editor.
3. Run the project to launch the main menu.

## Theme Customization
Edit `scripts/Theme.gd` to adjust the font paths or palette colors used by the UI.
